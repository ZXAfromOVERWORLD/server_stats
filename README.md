# Server_stats
A script which shows your remote server stats.

In this project I wrote a shell script which shows the following
Total CPU usage \
Total memory usage (Free vs Used including percentage) \
Total disk usage (Free vs Used including percentage) \
Top 5 processes by CPU usage \
Top 5 processes by memory usage

```bash
    chmod +x server-stats.sh

```

```bash
    ./server-stats.sh
```
